# TCP/IP based DistributedCommand 

A proof of concept of having an ICommand implementation that can broadcasts its execution to connected devices (to have them keep in sync). 

I can't remember when I wrote this, and it appears to be very hit & miss. Publishing more for archiving rather than thinking I'll use this or come back to it.
